# Image-Compressor
This code will help you compress images using python.
The code uses pillow library in python to open and compress the image.
PIL is Python Image Library. It allows you to load image data and modify it in many ways.

To use this just run the code:
1. It will open a window from where you can choose the image.
2. Choose the image and click open.
3. Another window will open for you to choose the new file name

Your file is saved in the same path as the image you chose.

Drawback of this code is that once a image is compressed, it connot be compressed again.
